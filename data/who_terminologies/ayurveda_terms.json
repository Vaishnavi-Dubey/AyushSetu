It presents with the following generic symptoms: loss of strength, heaviness, laziness, tastelessness or altered taste, and exhaustion even without physical or mental exertion. The ama phase is an initial stage of almost all disorders, e.g. fever or diarrhoea, which arises due to vitiation of endogenous factors: dosha, fundamental structural components and excretory products.
